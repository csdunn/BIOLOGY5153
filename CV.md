## Research Experience ## 

**University of Arkansas, Mechanobiology and Soft Materials Laboratory**	        		  August 2017 – Present
*Ph.D. Student*									       PI: Dr. Kartik Balachandran  
*The goal of my research is to study the molecular responses of astrocytes following one or more traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and the investigation of common secondary injuries that occur as a result of the primary insult.


**American Fork Hospital** 								             Jan 2017 – August 2017
*Medical Laboratory Science Intern*                  
*Oversaw all quality controls and procedures on lab specimens including: blood, urine, stool and tissue samples.
*Performed all clinical tests in blood bank, chemistry, hematology and microbiology departments in the hospital laboratory. 
*Drew blood from patients in outpatient clinic to provide further results in patients’ plan of care. 

**University of Arkansas, Mechanobiology and Soft Materials Laboratory**		           June 2016 – August 2016
*Student Research Assistant*								             	                
•	Studied the proteins of mouse astrocytes following a stimulated traumatic brain injury on a mechanical device.
•	Researched best methods for stimulating a blood brain barrier using PDMS gel and dextran. 
•	Performed procedures of the astrocyte project including: preparing and sterilizing plate and membrane, seeding astrocytes on membranes, stretching membranes, extracting cells, running BCA assays, gel electrophoresis and western blotting.

SYNERGISTIC ACTIVITIES
Research Mentor. As a research mentor, I take pride in providing undergraduate students at the University of Arkansas with research experiences to develop their research techniques and skills. I work with the students to develop a research goal and design and implement experiments to achieve their goal. Thus far, I have mentored 4 undergraduate students, 2 of whom received the Arkansas Student Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF).

Middle School Mentor. I have the opportunity of working with middle school students to design, plan and implement  science fair projects. I oversaw the project of an 8th grade student who extracted nicotine from cigarettes, grew mouse cancer cells and then treated the cells with calculated nicotine extract concentrations and observed the results. I taught the student how to use a cell culture hood, basic sterile cell culture techniques, how to extract nicotine from cigarettes, concentration equations as well as analysis after treating the cells. The student I mentored won her school science fair project and competed for regionals. 

Cub Scout Den Leader. As a den leader, I empower young children by teaching them valuable skills each week. I place greater emphasis on science. I organized a science involvement night for our cub scout pack and their families to teach them about different science career paths and show them different experiments. I also serve as a cub scout committee chair to ensure the children were receiving the best training each week.
